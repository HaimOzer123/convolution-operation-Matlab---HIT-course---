# HaimOzer - MATLAB Project
## Overview
This project contains MATLAB scripts developed by HaimOzer. The scripts are designed for signal processing tasks, including generating noisy waveforms and performing convolution operations. Below is a brief description of each script and its functionality.

## Files and Descriptions
1. **convolution.m**
This script performs a convolution operation between two signals.
Convolution is a key mathematical operation used in various fields such as signal processing, image processing, and systems analysis.
The script takes two input signals, convolves them, and produces the resulting output signal.
**Usage**: You can run this script by passing your input signals to it. The output will be the convolved signal, which can be used for further analysis or processing.

2. **NoisyWaveGeneratorPloting.m**
This script generates a noisy wave signal and plots the resulting waveform.
It simulates the addition of noise to a clean signal, which is a common scenario in signal processing where noise interference is analyzed.
**Usage**: Running this script will generate a wave signal with noise and display a plot of the waveform.
This is useful for visualizing how noise affects the signal and for studying the behavior of noisy signals.

# Getting Started
To run these scripts, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. 
Make sure your MATLAB environment is properly set up to execute .m files.

**Running the Scripts**
convolution.m:

Open the script in MATLAB.
Define your input signals within the script or pass them as function arguments.
Run the script to see the convolved output.
NoisyWaveGeneratorPloting.m:

Open the script in MATLAB.
Execute the script to generate and plot the noisy waveform.
